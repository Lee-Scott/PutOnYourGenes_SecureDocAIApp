# Refactoring Roadmap

This document outlines a refactoring roadmap for the application. The goal is to improve the codebase's quality, maintainability, and performance.

## 1. General

*   Rename "PatientDashboard" to "UserDashboard" and update related components.
*   Update the homepage to reflect the core functionality of the application (document upload, AI agents, chat, tagging, etc.).
*   Fix the PDF viewer issue in `src/components/documents/PaperlessDocumentDetails.tsx`.
*   Configure `src/service/PaperlessService.ts` to correctly communicate with the Paperless-ngx instance running on Docker at port 8000.
*   Add the `paperless-ngx-dev` directory to `.gitignore`.
*   Model and integrate the backend functionality for AI agents, chat, tagging, and other Paperless-ngx features.

## 2. Component Refactoring

*   **Abstract Reusable Form Components:** Create a set of reusable form components to handle common form elements, such as input fields, labels, and validation messages. This will reduce code duplication and ensure consistency across the application.
*   **Consolidate Profile Components:** Refactor the components in the `src/components/profile` directory to use the new reusable form components and eliminate redundant logic.
*   **Create a UI Component Library:** Establish a centralized library of reusable UI components to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.

## 3. State Management

*   **Create a User Slice:** Introduce a dedicated slice for managing user-related state, such as the user's profile, authentication status, and preferences.
*   **Expand Homepage State:** Expand the `homepageSlice` to include other homepage-related state, such as the list of featured documents or the status of the document upload process.
*   **Leverage RTK Query for Caching:** Ensure that RTK Query is being used effectively to cache user data and other API responses.

## 4. API Interactions and Error Handling

*   **Implement Specific Error Handling:** Add specific error handling logic to the API endpoints to provide more informative error messages to the user.
*   **Add Loading and Error States:** Implement loading and error states in the components that use the API hooks to provide a better user experience.
*   **Use Granular Cache Invalidation:** Use a more granular approach to cache invalidation to avoid unnecessary re-fetches of data.

## 5. Testing

*   **Create a Central Test Setup File:** Create a `vitest.setup.ts` file to centralize test configuration and global setup/teardown logic.
*   **Improve Test Coverage:** Increase test coverage for the application, especially for critical parts of the codebase.
*   **Implement End-to-End Testing:** Introduce end-to-end testing to ensure that the application works as expected from the user's perspective.

## 6. Performance

*   **Implement Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:** Use code splitting and lazy loading to reduce the initial bundle size and improve load times.
*   **Optimize Images:** Optimize images in the `assets/` directory for the web.
*   **Optimize Components for Performance:** Use `React.memo` and other optimization techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
*   **Analyze Bundle Size:** Use a bundle analyzer to identify large dependencies and opportunities for optimization.
